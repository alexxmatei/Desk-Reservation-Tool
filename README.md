# Desk-Reservation-Tool

# Pre-requisite software
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - open source server environment, runtime that allows you to run Javascript on a server;
* MongoDB - the most popular NoSQL database a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. There are two main options for using the database:
    * a local MongoDB database, in which case the [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) must be downloaded;
    * a cloud MongoDB database using [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas);

# Guide
1. Open CMD window in the root directory of the project;
2. Execute "node ." command;
    > "." means current directory, this works because node looks for an "index.js" file, otherwise the name of the ".js" file name would have to be specified instead of "." (ex: node fileName.js).
