# Pre-requisite software
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - open source server environment, runtime that allows you to run Javascript on a server;

# Guide
1. Open CMD window in the root directory of the project;
2. Execute "node ." command;
    > "." means current directory, this works because node looks for an "index.js" file, otherwise the name of the ".js" file name would have to be specified instead of "." (ex: node fileName.js).
