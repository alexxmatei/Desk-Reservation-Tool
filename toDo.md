# To Do
* Make the web page responsive
  * Idea: scale it based on width

# Ideas
* Host website externally for mobile phone access as well and no VPN access from personal devices;
* Find a better way to host a dinamic page (instead of writing a long HTML string);
* Add a Raspberry PI at entrance with presence;
* Add a real time clock in the app;
* Create a intro animation for the app (desks come into place);
  * SVG animation maybe;
* Add a Title graphic at top;
* Add alert when user clicks a bench (Reservation succesful / Desk unavailable)
* Make the site work in real-time, some ideas:
  * socket.io
  * angular
  * jQuery
  * maybe make the browser make request when user is active on page
    * for example when he moves the mouse on the canvas
* Add a popup where you can configure time of reservation
* Use images as well for reservations
  * Give the user the option to upload images to the server
* Add custom user fonds
* For mobile, force app to start in landscape
* Unreserved desk raise animation dependent on desk position
  * For example, in groups of 4 desks, bottom right desk raises bottom right, top left raises top left, etc.
* Look into:
    *   <html lang="en">
    *   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    *   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
* Add a document title for each page
* Add a favicon
